# Console Finances

## Overview
Welcome to Console Finances! In this challenge, you will be using JavaScript to analyze financial records of a company. This portfolio project showcases your skills in JavaScript and financial data analysis. The goal is to create a codebase that calculates and prints various financial metrics based on the provided dataset.

## Web Address
The deployed version of Console Finances can be accessed through the following link: [Console Finances](https://sanifmujawar.github.io/Console-Finances/)

## Dataset
You have been provided with a financial dataset in the `starter/index.js` file. The dataset is composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.

## Acceptance Criteria
* Create a new GitHub repo called "Sanif-Mujawar-Console-Finances". Then, clone it to your computer.
* Copy the starter files into your local git repository.
* Write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
  * The total number of months included in the dataset.
  * The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average. (Total/Number of months)
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
* Your final code should print the analysis to the browser console in a format similar to the following:

```text
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38,382,578
Average Change: $-2,315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1,926,159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2,196,167)
```

## Usage
To view the analysis, open the browser console. In most browsers, you can do this by right-clicking on the web page, selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element", and then navigating to the "Console" tab.

## Outcome

The resulting analysis should look similar to the example shown above.

## Solution

Your solution will demonstrate your JavaScript skills and financial data analysis capabilities. You will utilize JavaScript to manipulate the dataset, calculate the required financial metrics, and display the analysis in the browser console.

## Learning Outcome

During the development of this project, you will gain experience in JavaScript, data manipulation, and financial analysis. You will also learn to use the browser console as a tool for displaying output and debugging.

## Resources Used

In completing this project, you may refer to various resources, including documentation, tutorials, and online references related to JavaScript and data analysis.
